CurvedUltra=
[THEO right normal]
Tech #1:
[THEO right normal]
Curved ultra
[THEO right normal]
To perform a curved ultra, start by performing an extended hyper, then perform a down-diagonal dash, but curve it to completely horizontal at the end and jump off a surface.
[THEO right normal]
this will give a MASSIVE speed boost
[THEO right normal]
if done incorrectly, you will instead perform a super or hyper, which gives much less speed.
[THEO right normal]
try it out in this short challenge:

heagridswagerdadbothelpdialogflip=
[MADELINE left normal]
if you put character on right

[MADELINE right normal]
it will flip the picture automatically

[MADELINE left normal]
but sometimes you need something like

[MADELINE left normal flip]
this

[MADELINE right normal flip]
you can achieve this by writing flip after expression

[MADELINE left normal flip]
so: (character direction expression flip)

[MADELINE left normal upsidedown]
EVERY character can be upside down if you write upsidedown after expression
(character direction expression upsidedown)

[MADELINE left normal pop]
you can make  picture to pop

[MADELINE left normal pop]
it is a weird effect that looks like this, pay attention to picture

[MADELINE left normal pop]
see?

[MADELINE left normal pop]
you achieve this by writing pop after expression

[MADELINE left normal pop]
(character direction expression pop)

[MADELINE left normal upsidedown flip pop]
you can all combinate effects
(character direction expression upsidedown flip pop) in any order

[MADELINE left determined upsidedown flip pop]
all things can be used on EVERY character, directions and expressions work

[MADELINE left distracted]
you may also change expression by [MADELINE left normal] typing the text command in middle of line

[MADELINE left normal]
something like this:  character is talking {0.5}[MADELINE left distracted] (character direction expression) character is talking again

[MADELINE left normal]
please refer to the NOTES in the English.txt for advanced text {n}
or in the original celeste .txt file, for example {~}wavy text{/~}
